#  NAVI (Solidarity) - IoT Sensor Device

Winning solution for IBM's TechToProtect Challenge - IoT device with sensors for Emergency Responders built in conjunction with web and mobile applications.

## Motivation

The Tech to Protect challenge is designed to inspire participants to connect, collaborate, and create technologies of the future for public safety. Solidarity provides an integrated platform for Emergency Responders to locate each other and detect when they are in danger. This repo contains code for our IoT Device.

## Functionality

* Raspberry PI outfitted with sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure) that can be attached to clothing or equipment carried by emergency responders
* Emergency responders will be alerted with visual (LED Matrix) and audio messages when sensor readings exceed safe thresholds
* Web interface allows adjustment of alert thresholds and other settings
* Sensor readings are uploaded to backend API where they can be monitored by the incident commander
